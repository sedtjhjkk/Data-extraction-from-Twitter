2023-02-23 03:43:15+00:00,ViHero340,@TranquiloClubYT It was great. We got the announcement which was AW's reality show called AEW All Access which is happening next month March. And it was announced by Adam Cole who announced that he's returning to wrestling that same month. There has been a lot of great built towards this show for‚Ä¶
2023-02-23 03:42:42+00:00,xCapricornQueen,@viciousvixen326 @JoslynRoxBlue_ TK had an announcement to make but thought it would be bettet for Adam Cole to make the announcement instead since it involves top stars. Some eality show about AEW and it's wrestlers and Adam Coles journey will be included that's why he made the announcement not TK.
2023-02-23 03:42:39+00:00,MikeJBknows,Tony Khan having Adam Cole announce AEW All Access is the reason putting it on TV made sense. #AEWDynamite

The reality show is triggering some Total Divas PTSD though. Not planning on delving into that one at all."
2023-02-23 03:39:20+00:00,athletic_geek89,Truth be told I would‚Äôve been more ok with the announcement just being Adam Cole‚Äôs return.

As for Adam Cole‚Äôs return, they spoiled what could have been a surprise return or they could have made a story leading to it than just a basic announcement. What reason do I have to watch the show until then?"
2023-02-23 03:39:15+00:00,scootsie34,"Tony Khan is the epitome of having a meeting that should just be an email. That was your ""big announcement""? To have Adam Cole announce your announcement?! GTFO. #AEWDynamite"
2023-02-23 03:37:54+00:00,tak161,"@nodqdotcom Two things:
1. Did they really need to hype that as a ‚Äúhuge announcement‚Äù?

2. Did Tony Khan really need to be on camera at all for that?

This could have been done from the announce booth or a video package or just Renee interviewing Adam Cole. Khan was 100% not needed for that."

2023-02-23 02:53:54+00:00,bigman7874,@AEW @TonyKhan @AdamColePro I'm happy for Adam Cole however really you're big enough it's been was a reality TV show come on really
2023-02-23 02:53:54+00:00,lbotboi,@Kev_Emo @Variety Yes this and Adam Cole returning to the ring in March
2023-02-23 02:53:44+00:00,WrestleRant,"Interesting Adam Cole's first back match isn't at Revolution. Makes me think we're getting a smaller card at Revolution due to the Iron Man match, which is appreciated. #AEWDynamite"
2023-02-23 02:53:44+00:00,BearsFanPty,@_denisesalcedo The good announcement here is that Adam Cole is officially returning to the ring.
2023-02-23 02:53:40+00:00,WweNaF,"Adam Cole ha anunciado que AEW crea AEW ALL Access un show especial que se transmitira despues de AEW Dynamite a partir de Marzo, siento que es no habia necesidad de otro show de AEW ya que si a AEW Rampage no le va bien para que crear otro Show https://t.co/n98ichTy3Y"
2023-02-23 02:53:39+00:00,GenerationZed1,@_denisesalcedo Happy for Adam Cole but I think knowing what it was in hindsight it would've been nice to have announced before the show. A quick press release and then on the show adding the Adam Cole caveat to sweeten the deal as well as push further hype for March.
2023-02-23 02:53:39+00:00,LarryWi85687409,@_denisesalcedo Adam Cole reminds me of Triple H. Triple H with malnutrition and never seen the inside of a gym
2023-02-23 02:53:34+00:00,OCodplayer,"@DakotaKaiEra That‚Äôs may have been the most useless announcement they have ever done, that was a huge waste of time but I am glad we know that Adam cole bay bay will be back in the ring soon"
2023-02-23 02:53:32+00:00,davidK786,@AEW I have no problem w the all access show or the Adam Cole news but I think AEW should stop over hyping these ‚ÄúTK major/important announcements‚Äù that could have easily been announced without making it sound earth shattering.. #AEW #AEWDynamite
